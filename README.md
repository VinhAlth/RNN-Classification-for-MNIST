# RNN-Classification-for-MNIST
Implementing an RNN-based classification model for MNIST:  Data loader splits into train, validation, and test sets. Images are treated as sequential inputs over time in the RNN. Custom RNN class predicts image labels based on sequential pixel data. Explore the effectiveness of RNNs in image classification tasks.
